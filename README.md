# Polar Express

Get on board of The Polar Express and let's have a train ride to package tracking!

## Gem in development
Note: this gem is in current development, so don't expect anything to work yet (not even the usage example!!!)

Feel free to contribute to the project :)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'polar_express'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install polar_express

## Usage

```ruby
@tracker = PolarExpress.new('DHL', '017219678663')
info = @tracker.track!
info.status # => :delivered
info.percentage # => 100
